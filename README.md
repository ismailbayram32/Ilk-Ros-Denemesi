# 🤖 First ROS Project (ROS Basics)

This repository contains my first experiments with **ROS (Robot Operating System)**.

The purpose of this project was to get familiar with the ROS ecosystem, including basic concepts such as nodes, topics, publishers/subscribers, and message communication.

This repository represents my early-stage learning process in robotics software development.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main goals of this project were:

- Understanding the ROS architecture
- Learning how ROS nodes communicate
- Practicing topic-based messaging
- Building a foundation for future robotics projects

## 🧠 What I Learned

During this project, I explored:

- ROS workspace setup (`catkin_ws`)
- Creating and building ROS packages
- Writing simple ROS nodes
- Publisher / Subscriber structure
- Topic communication using `rostopic`
- Running nodes using `rosrun` and `roslaunch`
